Note: tabit is the name I chose for the db

Oracle XE 11g Express Edition

First, install VIM before you begin installation. (http://www.vim.org/download.php)

Start up the setup.exe. Wait for it to load. Accept user agreement.

In "Choose Destination Location," you should have it by default destination "C:\oraclexe" and if this is correct click next.

Enter a password of your choosing in the next screen. This is something of your choosing, but "default" will be used for this tutorial. Click next.

Double-check to make sure the installation is similar to below and click install.

Installation:

Destination Folder: C:\oraclexe\
Oracle Home: C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\
Oracle Base:C:\oraclexe\
Port for 'Oracle Database Listener': 1521
Port for 'Oracle Services for Microsoft Transaction Server': 2030
Port for 'Oracle HTTP Listener': 8080
This is all done in cmd as administrator all parameter files for a database must exist in the Oracle HOME (see above), go to the following directory:

cd C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\database
vim inittabit.ora
Inside the file "inittabit.ora" inside the open file in your text editor copy the following , save it and quit (Command is ":x" in VIM):

db_name=tabit
control_files="C:\database\oradata\tabit\control01.ctl"
Now set variables: [to see that the value was set properly type echo %ORACLE_SID%] or echo %ORACLE_HOME% for the second type the following in the cmd:

set ORACLE_SID=tabit
set ORACLE_HOME=C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\
create a windows service, type the following in the cmd:

oradim -new -sid tabit
[this automatically starts service] [how to delete -> oradim -delete -sid tabit]

You should get a message "Instance created."

If you get an error message, this may be because you are not running cmd as admin. Close your current command prompt, and reopen command prompt by right clicking and choosing "Run as administrator."

to start service: net start OracleServicetabit to stop service: net stop OracleServicetabit

cd ..
cd bin
You will now be in "C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\bin" for the next steps.

connect to the sid (tabit) with the highest authority type in the following in the cmd:

sqlplus / as sysdba 
looks for the inittabit.ora file it opens it determines db_name

SQL>startup;   	
SQL>quit
Create a createdb sql file to be executed [location can be anywhere i put them in the following directory C:\oraclexe\scripts] so create a folder called scripts and then cd to that folder using any text editor (i have VIM installed on my laptop)

vim createdb.sql
Copy the following inside the open file, save it and quit:

create database tabit
maxinstances 2
maxloghistory 1
maxlogfiles 16
maxlogmembers 5
maxdatafiles 100
datafile 'C:\database\oradata\tabit\system01.dbf' size 300m
reuse autoextend on next 10240k maxsize unlimited
extent management local
sysaux datafile 'C:\database\oradata\tabit\sysaux01.dbf' size 120m reuse
default temporary tablespace temp tempfile
'C:\database\oradata\tabit\temp01.dbf' size 10m reuse autoextend on
next 640k maxsize unlimited
undo tablespace undotbs1 datafile 'C:\database\oradata\tabit\undotbs1.dbf' size 100m reuse autoextend on next 5120k maxsize unlimited
character set we8mswin1252
national character set al16utf16
logfile group 1 ('C:\database\oradata\tabit\redo01.log') size 10m,
group 2 ('C:\database\oradata\tabit\redo02.log') size 10m,
group 3 ('C:\database\oradata\tabit\redo03.log') size 10m;
go back to C:\ in the cmd

cd ../..
then type in the following as it is in the cmd:

mkdir database 
cd database 
mkdir oradata 
cd oradata 
mkdir tabit 
cd tabit
in the same directory that you currently are type in, in the cmd:

sqlplus / as sysdba
now execute the command from scripts

SQL> @C:\oraclexe\scripts\createdb.sql;
wait a few moments... BOOM!

Database created. 

SQL>quit
Change directory to "C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\rdbms\admin" with the following command in the cmd:

cd ../../..
cd oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\rdbms\admin
now connect to sqlplus

sqlplus / as sysdba
enter the following command to execute the following file and wait:

SQL> @?\rdbms\admin\catalog.sql;
after completion execute the following command and wait:

SQL> @?\rdbms\admin\catproc.sql;
And now besides the XE database we have a TABIT database.

SQL> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON

SQL>exit
THIS IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT: how to create a user and grant access (this is all done from the command line)

sqlplus / as sysdba
Type in the following with the same username and password[THIS IS BECAUSE THE JAVA CODE IN GITHUB DATAHANDLER CLASS HAS THIS RECORDED]

SQL>create user nanunezr identified by tabit0427;
SQL>grant connect to nanunezr;
SQL>grant connect, resource, dba to nanunezr;
SQL>grant create session to nanunezr;
SQL>grant alter session to nanunezr;
SQL>grant unlimited tablespace to nanunezr;
SQL>grant create session, grant any privilege to nanunez;
// not sure about this one SQL>grant select, update, insert, delete on TABLENAMES*** to nanunezr;

SQL>exit
Now to log in as a regular user and with all privileges instead of dba admin

int the cmd: sqlplus

Enter username: nanunezr;
Enter password: tabit0427;

and you are now logged in
And that is it. The other stuff is for JDeveloper READ IT.




Possible errors when using the database:

1)ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE SET! echo %ORACLE_SID% this must say: 
tabit if not, set it: set ORACLE_SID=tabit
SAME THING FOR ORACLE_HOME

2)ORA-12560 Listener adapter error

to solve this problem go to a command prompt as administrator, type in: services.msc this will open a window look for: 
OracleServicetabit right click it and select properties, 
look for: Startup type: select Automatic click apply, then ok then close. 
Restart computer and it should now work. If youre still having problems refer to 1).
