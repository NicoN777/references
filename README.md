Document (some step by step guides) that I have created while as a student or out of curiosity.

Install and create an Oracle XE11g database on a Windows machine.
Create a user
Grant permissions
Configure Windows Services.

Last time I followed these steps it was in May 2015 on a Alienware M14x running Windows 7. I apologize before hand if the cmd commands are "basic", but they were written assuming the audience is not very familiar with a command line.
